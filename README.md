# The Hunted

*Something follows. It never stops. Run.*

## Description

A tense, atmospheric silhouette platformer where you are being hunted through a vast, cold industrial world. Every step echoes. Every shadow moves. And behind you — always behind you — something massive shifts in the dark.

You're a lost worker who died in a sealed facility fifty years ago. You don't remember dying. You only know you have to escape.

## How to Play

**Controls:**
- **Desktop:** Arrow keys or WASD to move. Space to jump. Down/S to duck.
- **Mobile:** On-screen buttons at the bottom of the screen.

**Objective:** Run through five distinct areas, each more treacherous than the last. Don't look back. Don't stop. The hunter is always gaining.

**Mechanics:**
- Jump over gaps and obstacles
- Stay on platforms above rising water
- Duck under low barriers in the dark
- The closer the hunter gets, the more the music fades — and the heartbeat takes over
- Your furthest distance is saved locally

## Areas

1. **The Entry** — Dim corridors, broken lights. An introduction to the cold.
2. **The Machines** — Grinding gears in the background. The hunter first appears, far in the distance.
3. **The Flood** — Water rises below. Stay on platforms or drown.
4. **The Dark** — Lights fail. Only your rim-light and the hunter's eyes in the distance.
5. **The End** — Full darkness. Water to your chest. The exit is close. Run.

## The Feeling

This game is about dread, not shock. It's about the slow certainty that something is coming and you cannot stop it. The music isn't there to fill silence — silence IS the music. When the heartbeat starts, you know.

## Built With

- **Three.js** — 3D rendering with bloom post-processing
